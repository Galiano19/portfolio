# portfolio

-- Following informtion is just to note decision i've been taking, this need to be rewritten:

- add a subfolder portfolio-app because the project can be extended with a backend in further iterations
- decided to dynamically route the projects by ID in Admin dashboard (less url friendly, but no need to make it url friendly for the dashboard)
- decided to add console.errors in fetchings for readability in the browser, a better strategy could be explore for that
